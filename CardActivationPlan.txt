Card Activation Plan

activations model
  card number "string"
  expiration date "string"
  Sequence # "string"
  batch # string
  Secure code string
  user_id int
  status = new, started, checked,active
  gift_card_id = default null, linked to GC

activation_calls  model
  sid string
  transcript
  audio_url
  type: activate || check || balance

CardActivationsController:
  download CSV
  upload CSV
    create records
    queue up background activation tasks
      activation task: make calls, save sid
ActivationsCallsController
    twilio makes request to endpoint, card_activation_id
      find activation with card_activation_id,
      Update activation with transcript audio
      update frontend via action cable?
    run check in background
      same as above

  enable user to set "active" if everything passes but our tanscription is wrong
    must have activation sid and check sid, etc. etc. before you can do this.

  Actioncable for updating front end with state

upload card, create a card_activation object. and a call object
background task to initiate calls (potentially action cable to update front end here too)
calls make callback to call controller
call controller checks and updates activations_card and call objects
then actioncable updates front end.
