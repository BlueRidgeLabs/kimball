To Nuke:
twilio_wufoos
submissions
programs
applications
events
receive_text controller
sms_invitations_controller -> probably just invitations controller with magic links

to repurpose: twilio_messages, probably should be all inbound and outbound messages in general. perhaps replace with mailbox

for adding a whole boatload of people to carts

GiftRocket Cards:
rename the giftcard model to "reward"
rename card_activation to giftcard
add cash/manual reward type: all 5555 batches go here. all old school gift cards go here.
add a reward type and reward ID.
rapidpro endpoint for sending gift cards for surveys only right now
  must have a research session ID. Adds person to RS, then gives reward.
  checks if person is in RS before starting survey.

Reward type is:
	gift card (card activation)
	legacy Card/Cash (manual input) -> has a receipt ID, add receipt upload
	giftrocket (run out and make the request after create/commit)

all reward types have a reward ID.
  Can have many manual and activated cards per RS
  only one giftrocket per RS

Budgets:
  teams have a Gift Rocket budget, we allocate to them. Draws down on total.
  gift rocket rewards draw down on budget.
  teams have a max,min per GR amount. $5/$100 etc.
  Check GR budget before sending reward.

Transaction Table of all GR things.
  BRL team is where GR budget starts, then BRL sends money to teams, and that goes into transactions
  nightly transaction check: does it all add up?




Attempt #2:
keep gift card, rename to reward. 
  rewardable_id, rewardable_type
  remove all batch/sequence, etc. that all lives in activation

card activation becomes gift card
add giftrocket model
add cashcard model -> holder for legacy cards



Reward:
  id
  rewardable_type: gift card, gift rocket, cash
  reward_id: foreign key
  research_session:
  person_id:
  user_id:
