To Nuke:
twilio_wufoos
submissions
programs
applications
events
receive_text controller
sms_invitations_controller -> probably just invitations controller with magic links

to repurpose: twilio_messages, probably should be all inbound and outbound messages in general. perhaps replace with mailbox

for adding a whole boatload of people to carts

GiftRocket Cards:
rename the giftcard model to "reward".
add a reward type and reward ID.
Reward type is:
	gift card (card activation)
	legacy Card (manual input)
	giftrocket (run out and make the request after create/commit)

all reward types have a reward ID.
  Can have many manual and activated cards.
  only one giftrocket.


Research Sessions can be a rapidpro group? maybe hit a button and export them?
rapidpro endpoint for sending gift cards?
